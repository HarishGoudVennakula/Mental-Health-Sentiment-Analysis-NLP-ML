This code is used for text classification. Specifically, it processes a dataset containing statements (text data) and their corresponding categories (labeled as status). The goal is to classify new text data into the correct category using machine learning models.

This process involves:

Data preprocessing
Feature engineering
Balancing the dataset
Training classifiers
Evaluating the performance of each classifier
